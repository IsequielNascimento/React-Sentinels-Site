        The Sentinel Initiative, created by Jayce, Latrel, Bato and until then
        managed by Mr. Latrel, aims to welcome and guide heroes of various ages,
        as well as fighting crime. Being a Brazilian philanthropic organization,
        it acts in the country of origin and all over the world, being one of
        the main defenses of humanity and also one of the main forces in the
        fight against super-villains.

        The initiative started after the tragic end of one of the greatest
        heroes ever, Sunshine, who was one of the first forces to fight
        super-villains along with the F.E.A.S. His legacy has been maintained by
        Latrel and his group of heroes, despite the ups and downs, they are
        always in the front line seeking a better life for humanity.
